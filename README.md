## Fitts' Law Project Overview

This project is a replication of Wallner et al. (2012)'s Fitt's Law github project publication.
The original project was developed as part of the User Interface Technologies course at the University of Copenhagen.

The application of Fitts' Law allowed participants to explore how different settings (target distance and size) that impact task difficulty and completion time. 
The test visualized how movement in 2D space influences performance in target acquisition tasks.
